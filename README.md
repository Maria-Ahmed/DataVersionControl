# Data Version Control
This AI-Makerspace workshop introduces PyCaret, an open-source low-code machine learning library in Python that automates machine learning workflows. The directory contains all the necessary files that you are going to need to practice this workshop on your own. You can start from opening `LoanClassification.ipynb` where you will find a button <a href='https://colab.research.google.com/github/alihussainia/AI-Makerspace/blob/master/PyCaret-Classification/LoanClassification.ipynb'>`Open in Colab`</a> to open the notebook in Google Colab, the IDE used in the workshop.


### Chief Reasons to Use DVC

1- Save and reproduce all of your data experiments
